# AudioDataHandling
Library for handling noncompressed, multichannel Audio data which can be build as either:

- native c++ lib
- dll for dotnet48
- dll for dotnet50

*there also a project for building dll linking against qt exists, and as well a project which builds on linux and on windows by gcc compiler / mingw compiler exist.. but since I don't had much time for maintainance, they are not in a 'up to date' state and so not contained within this repo..
