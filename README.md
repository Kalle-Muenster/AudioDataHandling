# AudioDataHandling
Library for handling noncompressed, multichannel Audio data which can be build as either:

- native c++ lib
- dll for dotnet48
- dll for dotnet50

*there also a project for building dll linking against qt exists, and as well a project which builds on linux and on windows by gcc /mingw compiler exist.. but since I didn't had much time for maintainance, these are not in some really 'up to date' states actually. so for now these are not contained within this repo actualy..
