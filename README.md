# AudioDataHandling
Library for handling noncompressed, multichannel Audio data which can be build as either:

- native c++ lib
- dll for dotnet48
- dll for dotnet50

*there also projects for building a dll linking against qt exists, and as well project which builds on linux and on windows by gcc /mingw compiler exist.. but since I didn't had much time for maintainance, these are not in some really 'up to date' states actually. so for now these are not contained within this repo actualy..  

### Supported file formats for loading buffers from:

- Windows (wav)
- Sun audio (au, snd)
- NetPbm (pam) ... (quite uncommon for transporting audiodata.. but really handy format for this)
